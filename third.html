    Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas earlier this week, causing massive destruction and killing at least 20 people.
    “My island of Abaco, everything is gone. No banks, no stores, no nothing,” said one resident of the Bahamas, Ramond A. King. “Everything is gone, just bodies.”
    Corporations and celebrities are mobilizing to offer disaster relief assistance. Here’s what they’re doing to help.
    Disney
    “The Walt Disney Company, led by Disney Cruise Line, has committed more than $1 million in cash and in-kind support to help relief and recovery efforts for those in The Bahamas affected by Hurricane Dorian,” the company tweeted on Tuesday.

    “We hope our $1 million donation will provide much-needed relief and help our neighbors, colleagues, and all those impacted by this devastating storm begin the long process of recovery as they work to put their lives and communities back together,” Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said in a statement.
    Chef José Andrés
    The Spanish chef is playing to his strengths to help in the Bahamas: He and his team are in Nassau serving thousands of meals to those in need.
    By Tuesday, Andrés, who has helped feed victims of other natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Florence, had already flown 2,000 sandwiches and more than 1,000 oranges to the island. He plans to serve at least 10,000 meals to people in the Bahamas.
